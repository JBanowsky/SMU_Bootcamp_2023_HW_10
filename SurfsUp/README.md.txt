******
Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. 

Although the task requested the use of ORM queries, the SMU course taught the skill using Inspect and read_sql.
This part involved using sql queries to analyze the data in a way that could be used later in the assignment in a Flask app.

******
Part 2: Design Your Climate App
Design a Flask API based on the queries performed in part one. 

******
Personal Reflection: The query aspect of this activity was simple. The Flask aspect was challenging.
